- gganimate short introdution (can't upload due to too large), but github is good enough to look at [gganimate package](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate) 
- [animation package demo](https://github.com/yihui/animation/tree/master/demo), interesting tree and leaf drawing.
- a very simple walking heart latex way, run like this:
  - pdflatex animate.tex
  - ./makeGIF.sh
